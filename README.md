# Pixelated-Ruby-Installer
### The Ruby Based Installer for Pixelated Studios Server Software

(WIP)

(Note: this project is a installer and configurer for Pixelated Studios Server Software. It creates directories, clones repos, fetches repos, and prints some text to guide the user through the process. Currently, nothing it does actually installs anything. It just pulls an empty repository. Now that this installer is done for it's current version, I will begin working on the Pixelated-Backup software that hasn't been started yet.)

(Also note: There is a few classes that aren't used yet and are error/bug addled. If you would like to help develop this project, namely help me fix up those unused classes, feel free to create a PR)
